 <span class="titleHourCode" >First Stage – Preparation </span>
  </br>
      Preparations began with the fact that we were looking for a place to conduct the lesson together. Each member put in  effort to find the right institution in time and get to work as soon as possible, since everyone was very interested in the project and was looking forward to the day when we would finally find ourselves in class in front of the students. Next, having chosen an institution and our roles, we began to study the educational material and rehearsed everything.
  </br>
 </br>
 <span class="titleHourCode"> Second Stage – Hour of Code Lesson</span>
  </br>
      The most significant day for our report was the day we conducted the lesson. All the students were so excited and happy that they arrived earlier than scheduled. During the time we had, specifically an hour, we managed to get acquainted with all the students, found out if anyone had prior knowledge on the topic, and set up the necessary equipment. The lesson didn't go perfectly, but it was good enough for everyone. The students' enthusiasm, support, and motivation helped us feel more comfortable and at ease. We are very grateful to the students for that!
  </br></br>
  <span class="titleHourCode">Final Stage – Report Writing</span>
  </br>
      Although we thought that the hardest part was over, we were completely wrong! The most difficult part was discussing and writing the report. Even though only two members wrote it, everyone participated in the discussion, because no one wanted to sit idle! And in the end, our group did a great job with such an interesting and educational project for a small group of students in our event!

                <article class="text1">
                    <p>
                        Our team successfully developed a website, dividing tasks into several stages: concept discussion, coding, and testing. The code writers <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/AlakbarliIbrahim" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Codecademy profile" id="profileLink" target="_blank" >Ibrahim </a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/ajafarli20551" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Codecademy profile" id="profileLink" target="_blank" >Aysun </a> focused on creating the structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the other members ,<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/zahrakarimova34762" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Codecademy profile" id="profileLink" target="_blank" >Zahra</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/yahyarza" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Codecademy profile" id="profileLink" target="_blank" >Yahya </a> was not able to commit and push the written code ,so they actively contributed ideas and helped with improvements. However, during development, we encountered issues with VS Code and GitHub, which often slowed down our progress. Despite this, the team provided strong support for each other, and no one gave up. We worked together efficiently, which allowed us to overcome all challenges. The website turned out to be simple but well-filled and functional. The participants who wrote the code had previously studied programming and had theoretical knowledge, but had never applied it in practice. It was a valuable experience, and the team managed to complete the task, demonstrating patience, persistence, and mutual support, which ultimately led to a great result.
